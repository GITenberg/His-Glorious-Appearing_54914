        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No truth of
        inspiration can be more clearly demonstrated than that God reveals
        his designs to his prophets, that men and nations may be prepared for
        their accomplishment. Before visiting with judgments, God has
        uniformly sent forth warnings sufficient to enable the believing to
        escape his wrath, and to condemn those who have not heeded the
        warning. This was the case before the flood. The wickedness of the
        world had become very great. Every imagination of the thoughts of the
        hearts of men was only evil. It would seem that they had forfeited
        all claims for consideration. Violence and corruption filled the
        earth, and the only way to eradicate evil was to destroy it with its
        workers. But before doing so, the world must be warned of the
        impending doom; and there was found one man who would engage in the
        work. Noah had faith in God, and preached for one hundred and twenty
        years the message of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
        006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        warning and salvation. His work also testified with his words.</p>

        when the nations had again become sunken in idolatry and crime, and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And due notice was
        given to righteous Lot, who, with his daughters, was preserved; and
        none, even in that guilty city, perished without due warning. Lot
        evidently warned the people; and in thus communing with them, was
        <span class="tei tei-q">“vexed with the filthy conversation of the
        wicked.”</span> 2 Peter 2:7, 8. His righteous life had been a rebuke
        to them; and we have every reason to believe that the holy example of
        Abraham in his worship of the true God was known to them. He had at
        one time been their saviour, and rescued their captives and spoil
        from the victorious enemy who was carrying them away. But when Lot
        warned his friends of the approaching doom, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he seemed as one that mocked.”</span> Gen. 19:14. They,
        like the antediluvians, persisted in sin, and drank of the wrath of
        God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a subsequent

        to that proud capital the startling message, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be destroyed.”</span>
        The consciences of those sinners told them the message was true; and
        from the least of them to the greatest they humbled themselves, and
        the overhanging judgment was averted.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before Christ
        commenced his earthly mission, John the Baptist was sent as the voice
        of one crying in the wilderness, <span class="tei tei-q">“Prepare ye
        the way of the Lord.”</span> By this means the expectation of the
        people was raised, and doubtless many were through it led to accept
        of salvation, while the generation at large was condemned for
        rejecting the light.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our Saviour in his
        time saw the destruction of Jerusalem just in the future of that
        generation, and faithfully warned the people, foretelling signs by
        which it might be known when the desolation thereof was nigh. Luke
        21:21. Such is the testimony of inspiration respecting the dealings
        of God with his people in past ages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All who accept the
        Bible as the inspired word of God acknowledge that he has been very
        faithful in warning people in past ages of impending judgments and
        other events which affected their eternal welfare. Such having been
        the divine plan in relation to past events, we would certainly be
        justified in anticipating such warnings of Christ's second coming as
        would comport with the importance of the event. But when we come to
        regard the future, and especially our own immediate future, the
        incredulity of very many is at once aroused.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what are the
        facts in the case? Can anything be learned from the Bible relative to
        the time of the second advent? This is a grave inquiry; and, from the
        very nature of the subject, is worthy of close investigation, and a
        candid answer. It is a matter of painful regret that many, under the
        influence of popular prejudice, have decided that the period of the
        second advent is a secret, hidden with the Lord. While these can
        scarcely be reached with this subject, as long as they remain under
        the influence of those who denounce all investigation of it as prying
        into the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg
        009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        secrets of the Almighty, there is still, we believe, a larger class
        who wait for evidence before deciding.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We accept the
        Bible as a revelation from heaven. What God has revealed in that
        book, let no man call a mystery, or a secret of the Almighty.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The secret things belong unto the Lord our
        God; but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our
        children forever.”</span> Deut. 29:29. If the sacred Scriptures, in a
        most clear and harmonious manner, point out the signs of the approach
        of that great event, and if there is evidence that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“it is near, even at the doors,”</span> the subject at
        once assumes great importance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the disciples
        inquired, <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall be the sign of thy
        coming, and of the end of the world?”</span> Jesus did not reprove
        them for inquiring into this matter, nor tell them that it was
        purposely hidden from all men; but he answered their question in the
        most definite manner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The simple fact
        that the Lord mentions signs of his second advent, is the best proof
        possible that his people were not to remain ignorant of the relative
        nearness of the event. Add to this his injunctions to watchfulness,
        and the blessings which he pronounces upon those who are awake and
        watching at his coming, and it becomes a certainty that he would not
        leave his people ignorant of the proximity of that event. Paul also
        says that <span class="tei tei-q">“unto <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them that look for
        him</span></em> shall he appear the second time without sin unto
        salvation.”</span> Heb. 9:28. And that a crown of righteousness will
        be given <span class="tei tei-q">“unto all them also that love his
        appearing.”</span> 2 Tim. 4:8.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these
        assurances we may look for plain and emphatic tokens of the Saviour's
        second coming.</p>

        and their temple. The disciples supposed that the temple would stand
        forever, and they called the attention of Christ to its magnificence
        and strength, and to the great stones that entered into the
        structure. On this point the historian of those times, Josephus,
        says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now the temple was built of stones
        that were white and strong, and each of their lengths was twenty-five

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This statement
        from the Master could not but deeply interest the disciples. And it
        matters not whether they supposed that the destruction of the temple,
        the coming of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg
        012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Christ, and the end of the age, would all occur at the same time, or
        at different periods, since Christ, in his answer in this chapter,
        has distinctly spoken of each separately, and has given each its
        place in the prophetic history of events. If it were their impression
        that the overthrow of the temple and the end of the world would occur
        at the same time, it by no means proves that this would be the case.
        As the Scriptures show, up to the time of the out-pouring of the Holy
        Spirit on the day of Pentecost, their ideas upon many points were
        crude and inaccurate. Take as proof of this the parable which the
        Lord spake when he was going into Jerusalem. Luke 19. They thought
        that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. To correct this
        impression, the parable of the nobleman was spoken. If they
        understood the parable at the time when it was spoken, it did not
        fully eradicate the impression from their minds, as is proved by what
        they did when they entered Jerusalem. We cannot believe that they
        would have hailed him as the Son of David, and rejoiced before him as
        a King in his triumph, if they had realized that he was going into
        the city to be condemned and crucified as a malefactor. Palm branches
        and shouts of triumph did not attend the steps of the lowly and the
        condemned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John admits for
        himself and Peter, after they had seen the empty sepulcher, that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“they knew not the scripture, that he must
        rise again from the dead.”</span> John 20:9.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, after his
        resurrection, Jesus reproved two of his disciples, who, though they
        had trusted that he would redeem Israel, were then sad and
        disheartened. They did not then understand that Christ ought
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to have suffered these things, and to enter
        into his glory.”</span> The suffering part was still a mystery to
        them. And some of the apostles were so slow to realize that which he
        had spoken to them, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg
        013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that they could hardly be persuaded that he was indeed risen from the
        dead. And after he had been with them full forty days, speaking to
        them of the things pertaining to the kingdom, they did not yet
        understand <span class="tei tei-q">“the times and the
        seasons,”</span> and therefore asked him, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom
        to Israel?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However the matter
        may have been entertained in the minds of the disciples, it is
        evident that their query consisted of two distinct questions in the
        mind of the Saviour. These questions relate, first, to the
        destruction of Jerusalem; and, second, to Christ's second coming at
        the end of the world or age. They were distinctly answered by our
        Lord; not, however, before the promiscuous multitude; but on the
        occasion of a private interview with his disciples. Christ here
        speaks to his disciples; hence his words in this prophetic discourse
        are addressed especially to the church.</p>

        hearts of men, and that many impostors would arise, and deceive
        multitudes. He here warns his disciples, and guards them against the
        deceptions of corrupt and ambitious men. Such was the general
        expectation of the appearance of the Messiah among the Jews, that
        many would set up the claim that they were the Christ, to carry out
        selfish purposes, or to gain notoriety, and the credulous people
        would be easily led into the deception, and then be destroyed for
        sedition. We are informed that in the days succeeding those of
        Christ, impostors arose in great numbers. Josephus tells us of an
        Egyptian false prophet who led 30,000 men into the desert to show
        them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name=

        of the second century Cazibee set himself at the head of the Jewish
        nation and proclaimed himself their long-expected Messiah. To
        facilitate the success of his bold enterprise he changed his name to
        that of Barchocheba, alluding to the Star foretold by Balaam. Adrian
        raised an army, and sent it against him. He retired into a town
        called Bither, where he was besieged. Barchocheba was killed in the
        siege, the city was taken, and a dreadful havoc succeeded. The Jews
        themselves allow that, during this short war against the Romans in
        defense of this false Messiah, they lost five or six hundred thousand

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is proper that
        we should consider what is meant by the term <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the end,”</span> used in this verse; in verse 14,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“then shall the end come;”</span> and in
        verse 3, <span class="tei tei-q">“the sign of thy coming, and the end
        of the world.”</span> In the first place, it may be unhesitatingly
        claimed that the term does not refer to the end of the Jewish
        dispensation, which terminated at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the crucifixion, nor to the destruction of
        Jerusalem, which occurred about forty years later. Because, first,
        Jesus treated the question concerning the destruction of the temple
        and that referring to his coming and the end of the world as relating
        to two distinct events, widely separated in time. Second, the signs
        which were to be premonitory of the end did not transpire before the
        destruction of the temple. Third, the second coming of Christ, the
        close of probation, the judgment, the resurrection, and the end of
        sin, death, and mortality, are frequently and prominently associated
        together in the Bible as constituting the most important epoch in
        human history. To limit this thrilling discourse to the local and
        long past destruction of Jerusalem would be to rob it of its force
        and grandeur. Not only would the twenty-fourth of Matthew which we
        are now studying be stultified, but very much of the life and power
        of the Scriptures would be sacrificed by such a course.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the meaning
        of the phrase, <span class="tei tei-q">“the end of the world,”</span>
        it may consistently be translated <span class="tei tei-q">“the end of
        the age,”</span> and in the margin of the Revised Bible it is
        rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“the consummation of the
        age.”</span> For an inspired definition of the term, let the reader
        turn to Matt. 13:38-40 and its context, where the same words are used
        and repeated in the original:—</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the
        world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are
        gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this
        world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
        gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do
        iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
        weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Rev. 14:14-16
        we learn that the harvest of the earth and the second coming of

        that by no possible means could it be established that the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“end of the world”</span> means the
        destruction of Jerusalem. Further evidence is found in Matt. 28:20
        where the same expression, both in the original and in the
        translation, is used: <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo I am with you
        alway, even unto the end of the world.”</span> But no one would have
        the audacity to claim that this promise expired in <span class=

        d.</span></span> 70, as it must have done if those questions of the

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wars, famines,
        pestilences, and earthquakes have occurred all along since these
        words were spoken. Therefore, these, as they have ever existed,
        cannot be regarded as the especial signs of the end. It may be
        claimed, however, with a good degree of consistency, that the
        Scriptures teach that these calamities would abound in the last days
        to such an extent as to constitute a sign of the approaching
        Judgment. We wish to keep the important fact distinctly before the
        mind, that the sacred Scriptures do teach when men may not, and when
        they may, look for the second appearing of Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sacred writers
        have so uniformly associated such judgments as war, famine,
        pestilence, and earthquake, with the last Judgment, that the
        disciples would be in danger of concluding that the end would
        immediately follow the first appearance of these calamities; hence
        the caution given: <span class="tei tei-q">“These things must come to
        pass, but the end is not yet.”</span> Here the disciples were clearly
        taught that they should not expect the end in their day. This fact is
        worthy of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg
        018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        candid attention of those who object to the proclamation of the
        second advent of Christ in the form of an especial message. These
        sometimes assert that it was right for the disciples to look for
        Christ in their day, and that it has been scriptural and right for
        all Christians to look for the second appearing of Christ in their
        time, from the days of the chosen twelve to the present time. And
        they decide that no more can be learned and believed upon this
        subject in our time than by the Christians of past generations, and
        that the public mind should not now be moved upon this great
        question, any more than in all past time since the first advent of
        Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen that
        this position is incorrect so far as the early disciples were
        concerned. They are directed to the distant future as the time when
        their Lord should come. They are assured that they need not be
        troubled at hearing of wars and rumors of wars; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for all these things must come to pass, but the end is
        not yet.”</span> Our Lord then guides the minds of his disciples, as
        we shall see in the examination of this chapter, down over the time
        of the great apostasy, and the long period of the rule of papal Rome,
        before mentioning a sign of his second advent. He does not intimate
        that his people during these long periods may expect the end. No, not
        once. But when he comes to a later time, the Lord names signs in the
        sun, in the moon, and in the stars, and adds: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When ye shall see all these things, know that it is
        near, even at the doors.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mark this: Our
        Lord does not mention wars, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes as
        signs of his second advent; but rather as events of common occurrence
        all the way through the Christian age, which must exist before the
        end. And history attests the fact that these calamities have
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019"

          description of the afflictions and martyrdom of the church of
          Christ. Thousands of the faithful followers of Jesus were most
          cruelly put to death by pagan Rome; yet the prophecy doubtless
          applies more particularly to the long period of papal persecutions,
          in which not less than fifty millions of Christians were put to
          death in the most cruel manner that wicked men and demons could
          devise. In these verses we are brought down over the long period of
          the martyrdom of the church of Jesus Christ, to near the present
          generation. These verses being parallel with verses 21 and 22, this

          iniquity in the unconverted world alone, would stimulate the church

          the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">end</span></em>, whenever used in this
          chapter, refers to the end of the age, and to nothing else. It is
          the end associated in the New Testament with the second appearing
          of Jesus Christ. If it be urged that the word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“end”</span> has reference to the close of mortal life,
          then we reply that the disciples did not ask their Lord (see verse
          3) when they should die; but <span class="tei tei-q">“what shall be
          the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?”</span>
          Neither does the Lord speak of death, when he says (see verse 6),
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But the end is not yet.”</span> And it
          would be strange indeed to suppose that the word <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“end”</span> (verse 14) meant death. If any think such
          a position admissible, let them read it into the text, as follows:
          And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world,
          for a witness unto all nations, and then shall death come.
          Absurdity!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the
          first sign of the end given by our Lord in answer to the question,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“What shall be the sign of thy coming, and
          of the end of the world?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is robbed
          of its distinct power by that interpretation, sometimes given, by
          which it is assumed that all men will receive the gospel and be
          converted, and that then <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg
          028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          instead of the end, there will ensue a thousand years in which all
          shall know the Lord. After this long period of peace and safety,
          the end will come. How much is assumed on this text will appear
          when we consider that the text does not say that every individual
          will even hear this gospel of the kingdom. It does not state that
          any one will be converted and made holy by it. And we find it far
          from intimating that the world will be converted and remain so one
          thousand years. We have no reason to conclude that greater measure
          of success is implied in this text than that which has always
          attended the preaching of the gospel. While a few have believed and
          received it, the great mass of men have passed it by unheedingly.
          The text simply states: First, <span class="tei tei-q">“And this
          gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world;”</span>
          second, <span class="tei tei-q">“For a witness unto all
          nations;”</span> third, <span class="tei tei-q">“And <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em>
          [not one thousand years later, but <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          come.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But to what does
          the term <span class="tei tei-q">“gospel of the kingdom”</span>
          refer? The query sometimes rises as to whether the gospel in the
          common acceptation of the word, or a gospel peculiarly related to
          the second coming of Christ is here meant. No such distinction is
          to be drawn. There neither is, has been, nor will be more than one
          gospel. <span class="tei tei-q">“But though we, or an angel from
          heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have
          preached unto you, let him be accursed.”</span> Gal. 1:8.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gospel,
          then, in this instance, is the same as Paul preached, which was the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“power of God unto salvation to every one
          that believeth.”</span> But in Rev. 14:6 and 7 we read:—</p>

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
          "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em">

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gospel is
          here called the <span class="tei tei-q">“everlasting
          gospel,”</span> and must necessarily be referred to the gospel of
          Christ. In connection with the preaching of that gospel, was the
          proclamation that the judgment hour had come. Not that this message
          was appended to the gospel, but the angel who had the everlasting
          gospel to preach said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear God ... for
          the hour of his judgment is come.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gospel of
          Jesus Christ embraces all truth relating to salvation. The
          warnings, counsel, invitations, promises, precepts, prophecies, or
          whatever the Lord would have the people hear,—the gospel embraces
          them all. In the days of Noah, the gospel included repentance,
          faith, obedience, with the promises of grace and mercy; it also
          included the warning of the impending judgment. And the only way to
          escape that judgment was through the gospel. So here in Revelation
          we have the gospel with all it implies, including the message of
          Christ's second coming and kingdom and the judgment. Closely
          associated with this message are two others as given in Rev.
          14:8-12. The first is merged into these. Then immediately following
          their proclamation we have the following scene:—</p>

          "font-size: 90%">And I looked and behold a white cloud, and upon
          the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a

          the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was
          reaped.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
          <span style="font-size: 90%">Rev. 14:14-16.</span></p>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Rev. 14:6-16,
          then, we learn what is the meaning of the term <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“gospel of the kingdom.”</span> It is <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em>
          gospel, and it embraces the admonitions and instructions relative
          to the second coming of Christ. And now that we have reached that
          time, the complete gospel embraces the good <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> news of the coming kingdom with
          appropriate warnings and teachings. Our Saviour says it
          <span class="tei tei-q">“shall be preached in all the world for a
          witness unto all nations.”</span> The Revelator says the message is
          to be preached <span class="tei tei-q">“to every nation, kindred,
          tongue, and people.”</span> When this shall be done, the end will
          come.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The world-wide
          proclamation of the soon coming of Christ was inaugurated about
          1832. Since that time, the work of extending its warning voice has
          gone on. A most remarkable feature of this movement is the fact
          that in different countries individuals were moved upon, almost
          simultaneously, to study the prophecies and proclaim the nearness
          of the end, although they knew nothing of what was being done by
          others. In the United States and Canada, in Great Britain, Norway,
          Sweden, Germany, and in Asia, a profound interest in this subject
          was created, and people were led to expect the early appearance of
          Jesus. Since that time clearer light has appeared in connection
          with the other messages of Revelation 14, and still the work is
          onward. Wherever the light of the Bible has penetrated, the good
          news of the coming Saviour is now going. Not only so, but
          messengers bearing this gracious warning are rapidly finding their
          way into the dark portions of the earth. Evidence of its extent and
          progress might be expressed in facts and figures, but the rapid
          development of the work would soon leave these in the rear. Let it
          suffice to say that at present the everlasting gospel is being
          preached and published in all the leading languages and countries
          of the world. The work has encircled the globe. It is rapidly
          reaching every nation. We now wait for the approaching end; for
          when the purpose of God in the proclamation of the coming reign of
          Christ shall be fully accomplished, then the end will
          come.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far in this
          discourse Jesus has passed over the entire Christian dispensation.
          Beginning with a warning against the deceptions that were to
          succeed his own times, he next describes wars and disasters,
          persecutions, apostasy, the perils of the last days, and closes

        be impracticable to flee from a city after it was encompassed with
        armies; but our Saviour did not speak at random. Josephus tells us
        that Cestius, the Roman general who first led the attack upon
        Jerusalem, became dismayed at the apparent forces and strength of the
        city, and after having surrounded the city raised the siege. The

        going to sink.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. A. Clarke,
        commenting on verse 16, says:—</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        "font-size: 90%">This counsel was remembered and wisely followed by
        the Christians afterwards. Eusebius and Epiphanius say, that at this
        juncture, after Cestius Gallus had raised the siege, all who believed
        in Christ left Jerusalem and fled to Pella, and other places beyond
        Jordan.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The flight of the
        Christians of Judea to the mountains would be attended with
        difficulties. And their subsequent condition would be that of
        hardship and suffering. The Lord knew this, and gave them the
        instructions and warnings necessary. The statement of verse 19 was
        given to save them from the sorrows of unnecessary woe. That was a
        time of trouble.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus recognizes
        the existence of the Sabbath, in verse 20, as late as the destruction
        of Jerusalem, as verily as he does the seasons of the year.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
        Sabbath</span></span>, is the uniform <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> term of both Testaments to designate the very
        day on which Jehovah rested after the creation, the day upon which he
        put his blessing, and which he set apart for man. Not only in this
        instance does our Saviour show his regard for the sacred day of rest,
        but in his life he kept it (see Luke 4:16); in his teaching he upheld
        it, and taught its true character (Matt. 12:12); and when he lay in
        the tomb, the devout women reverently rested <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“according to the commandment.”</span> He himself is Lord
        of the Sabbath, and he declares that it was made for man. Mark 2:27,
        28. Jesus does not speak of the Sabbath as being only a seventh part
        of time, or one day in seven, and no day in particular. The Sabbath
        is the term used, referring to the last day of the first week of
        time, and to the last day of each subsequent week.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is thus that
        Jesus answered the question, <span class="tei tei-q">“When shall
        these things be?”</span> He now proceeds to answer the second great
        question.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
        surprising, perhaps, that upon a casual reading some should conclude
        that this verse had its fulfillment at the siege of Jerusalem by
        Titus. It was a time of great suffering, and the verse follows so
        closely those which relate to the destruction of the city, that this
        explanation suggests itself readily enough. But for good reasons we
        cannot accept that application of this verse. Jesus is giving a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035"
        id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> continuous prophecy. The
        narrative proceeds from verse to verse along the line of the entire
        dispensation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“great tribulation”</span> mentioned in verse 21 is that
        of the church of Christ, and not the tribulation of the Jews at the
        destruction of Jerusalem. We offer the following reasons for so
        deciding:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. It is a fact
        that the tribulation of the Christian church, especially under the
        reign of the papacy, was greater than God's people had suffered
        before <span class="tei tei-q">“since the beginning of the
        world.”</span> The tribulation of the Christian church has been
        greater than it will ever be again. True, a time of trouble
        <span class="tei tei-q">“such as never was,”</span> spoken of in Dan.
        12:1, is coming <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">upon the wicked</span></em>; but we find in the
        same verse this blessed promise, <span class="tei tei-q">“And at that
        time thy people shall be delivered.”</span> The tribulation of the
        Jews at the destruction of Jerusalem was not greater than the world
        will ever witness. The vials of Jehovah's unmingled wrath are yet to
        be poured out, not upon the people of one nation only, but upon the
        guilty people of all nations.</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. If the
        tribulation be applied to the Jews, or to any other class of
        unbelieving men, it cannot be harmonized with Dan. 12:1, which speaks
        of the time of trouble such as never was, when Michael shall stand
        up. Certainly there cannot be two times of trouble at different
        periods, greater than ever was or ever would be. Therefore the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“tribulation”</span> spoken of in Matt.
        24:21, 29, applies not to the Jews, but to the church of Christ,
        extending through the 1260 years of papal persecution; and the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“trouble”</span> mentioned in Dan. 12:1, to
        the unbelieving world, to be experienced by them in the
        future.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The period of
        tribulation was shortened for the elect's sake. This cannot refer to
        the Jews, for their house had been pronounced desolate. They were
        left of God in their hardness of heart and blindness of mind. Says
        Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo, we turn to the Gentiles.”</span>
        The elect were the followers of our Lord Jesus Christ. And where were
        they when tribulation was upon the Jews?—They had fled to the
        mountains. It is absurd, then, to say that the days of tribulation of
        the Jews in the city of Jerusalem, were shortened for the sake of the
        elect, who had fled from the place of tribulation. Moreover the
        tribulation that came upon Jerusalem was not restrained or modified,
        but continued until the city was destroyed and its people were given
        to the sword and to captivity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. The connection
        between verses 20 and 21 shows that the tribulation was to commence
        with those Christians who were to flee out of the city. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,
        neither on the Sabbath-day; for then shall be great
        tribulation.”</span> Our Lord here speaks of the tribulation which
        his people would suffer from the time of their flight onward. We
        follow them in their flight to the mountains, and then pass along
        down through the noted persecutions of the church of God under pagan
        Rome, and we see, indeed, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tribulation</span></em>. And when we come to the
        period of papal persecutions, we see them suffering the most cruel
        tortures, and dying the most dreadful deaths that wicked men and
        demons could inflict. This last period is especially noted in
        prophecy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prophet Daniel
        saw the papacy, its blasphemy, its ignorance, its work of death on
        the saints, and its duration as a persecuting power, under the symbol

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is generally
        admitted that <span class="tei tei-q">“a time and times and the
        dividing of time”</span> is 1260 years. The proof of it may readily
        be seen by comparing Rev. 12:14, 6; 13:5, with the scripture just
        quoted. In these passages we learn that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“time, times, and the dividing of time”</span> is
        equivalent to a thousand two hundred and threescore days, which
        equals three and one half Biblical years, or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“forty and two months.”</span> Applying the scriptural
        rule of interpretation, a day for a year (Eze. 4:6), we have 1260
        years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This period is to
        cover the supremacy of the papacy. The beginning of it will be the
        point of the establishment of the power of the papacy. This was the
        year 538 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a. d.</span></span> Justinian, emperor of
        Rome, with his capital at Constantinople, espoused the cause of the
        bishop of Rome; and in 533 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a. d.</span></span> issued a decree which
        constituted that prelate head of all the churches. But the Arian
        Ostrogoths had possession of Rome, and it was not until they had been
        rooted up that the city was accessible to the bishop. This was
        accomplished in 538, by Belisarius, Justinian's celebrated general.
        For a concise and clear account of this occurrence we refer the
        reader to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Two Republics,”</span> by A.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The papacy was
          clothed with civil power to punish heretics, which it held for 1260
          years; and had not the period of tribulation of the elect in the
          providence of God been shortened, the martyrdom of the church would
          have continued to 1798, in which event, no flesh of the elect would
          have been saved. But the Reformation under Martin Luther, and those
          associated with this great reformer, modified this tribulation, and
          continued to restrain the rage and power of the papacy until the
          suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, since which time, there has
          been no general persecution waged against the church. Thus we are
          brought in this prophetic discourse of our Lord, down into the
          eighteenth century, very near the present time. We would naturally
          expect, then, that the instructions and warnings which follow would
          be applicable to this generation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these verses
          the great theme of Christ's second coming is again vividly brought
          forth. Satan is ever on the alert to contravene by some device or
          art, the work of God. His most successful plan is to deceive. By
          this means he gains ready access to all such as desire to evade the
          force of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg
          041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          truth. And having deceived an individual, he not only prevents his
          salvation, but gains to himself an adherent if not an active agent.
          So, as the time for the second advent draws near, the enemy becomes
          particularly active, knowing that he hath but a short time. In the
          words last quoted our Lord seeks to prepare the minds of his people
          for the deceptions that are to be practiced upon those who live
          near the time of his second coming. There will be those who will
          cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo, here; or Lo, there,”</span> some

          truth in regard to Christ's coming in various plausible or
          fanatical ways. Others, in order to reach other minds, will present
          theories of human device accounting for the advent of Christ in
          various so-called rational schemes. Many sincere people will be led
          to expect the conversion of the world through a millennium of
          peace. Others will be persuaded that the coming of Christ means
          death. And even false prophets, showing great signs and wonders,
          will appear. All these form an atmosphere of deception, the miasma
          of which will stupefy, if it were possible, the elect of God.</p>

          evasions of the truth will ever be able to counterfeit the real
          event. The Roman army did not come to Jerusalem in this way. Death
          does not come in this way. The deceptive wonders of Spiritualism
          cannot imitate the glory of Christ's second coming. He will come in
          power and great glory (verse 30); he will come in the glory of his
          Father (chapter 16:27); and in the glory of the holy angels (Luke
          9:26); all the holy angels shall come with him. Matt. 25:31. His
          coming will be as glorious and resplendent as the lightning. When
          Jesus revealed himself to Saul of Tarsus, there was a light above
          the brightness of the sun (Acts 26:13); of the angel who appeared
          at the tomb after the resurrection of Jesus it is said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“His countenance was like lightning”</span>
          (Matt. 28:3); and Ezekiel says of the messengers of the Most High,
          they <span class="tei tei-q">“ran and returned as the appearance of
          a flash of lightning.”</span> Eze. 1:14.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Jesus comes
          in the glory of his Father, with so glorious a train attendant, his
          coming will indeed be as the lightning coming out of the east and
          shining to the west, and no one will have any more occasion or
          opportunity to say to his fellow, <span class="tei tei-q">“See
          here,”</span> than one would have to call another to behold a gleam
          of lightning flashing through the heavens. The vivid lightning
          flashing out of the distant east, and shining even to the west,
          lights up the whole heavens. What, then, when the Lord comes in
          flaming glory, and all the holy angels with him? The presence of
          only one holy angel at the sepulcher where Christ lay dead, caused
          the Roman guard to shake, and become as dead men. The light and
          glory of one angel completely overpowered those strong sentinels.
          The Son of man is coming in his own kingly glory, and in the glory
          of his Father, attended by all the holy angels. Then the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This makes the
          time in which the sun was to be darkened more distinct and
          definite. The days of tribulation were the 1260 years of papal
          supremacy, beginning in 538 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a. d.</span></span> and ending with the
          capture of Rome and the pope by the French in 1798. But we have

          or persecution of those days was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“shortened”</span> for the elect's sake. That is, the
          active persecution of the church by papal power ceased in 1773.
          Then, according to Mark's statement, the sun should be darkened
          between that date and 1798. It was fulfilled. May 19, 1780, has

          their roosts, and the birds to their nests, and the cattle
          returning to their stalls. Indeed thousands of the good people of
          that day became fully convinced that the end of all things

          pursuits, and betook themselves to religious

          can be fulfilled is a query with some people, who, perhaps
          captiously, remark that it would be impossible, since the earth
          itself is but a small body compared with many of the vast worlds of
          space. But all such queries are out of date now since the sign
          itself has already been witnessed. On the night of November 13,
          1833, the grandest display of celestial fireworks ever beheld took
          place. From works of accepted authority we take the following
          descriptions of this remarkable event:—</p>

          of which the world has furnished any record, was witnessed
          throughout the United States on the morning of the 13th of
          November, 1833. The entire extent of this astonishing exhibition
          has not been precisely ascertained; but it covered no
          inconsiderable portion of the earth's surface.... The first
          appearance was that of fireworks of the most imposing grandeur,
          covering the entire vault of heaven with myriads of fire-balls,
          resembling sky-rockets. Their coruscations were bright, gleaming,
          and incessant, and they fell thick as the flakes in the early snows
          of December. To the splendors of this celestial exhibition the most
          brilliant sky-rockets and fire-works of art bear less relation than
          the twinkling of the most tiny star to the broad glare of the sun.
          The whole heavens seemed in motion, and suggested to some the awful

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the sixth
          seal, as given in Rev. 6:12-17, we have the following
          language:—</p>

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
          "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em">

          "font-size: 90%">And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal,
          and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as
          sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the stars of
          heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely
          figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven departed
          as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and
          island were moved out of their places.</span><span style=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the fourth
          and fifth seals apply to the papal persecution there can be no
          reasonable doubt. If so, then the great earthquake with which the
          sixth seal opens would be that of Lisbon, in 1755, which agitated
          the greater part of the earth and destroyed many thousands of
          lives, 60,000 in Lisbon alone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The darkening of
          the sun and moon follows in 1780, and the falling of the stars in
          1833. Consequently the next event which we are to expect under this
          seal is the departing of the heavens as a scroll. This being
          future, we may say that we are living between the thirteenth and
          fourteenth verses of Revelation 6.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the gospel as
          written by Luke, however, we have at this point some additional
          specifications given, which are of such interest at the present
          juncture. And they rightfully belong to this exposition, since both
          Matthew and Luke are giving versions of the same discourse. The
          passage from Luke to which reference is made is the following:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The signs in the
          sun, moon, and stars are here spoken of less specifically than by
          Matthew, while other features of the times, which Matthew does not
          notice, are introduced between those signs and the shaking of the
          powers of heaven. These are of peculiar interest to us because we
          are living in the very days when the things that Luke speaks of are
          coming to pass. The signs here predicted consist of violent
          commotions upon earth which cause anxiety, perplexity, and distress
          among nations and in the hearts of men. We may refer the
          expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“the sea and the waves
          roaring,”</span> to unusual disturbances of the natural elements,
          and we have the most abundant evidences of its fulfillment in the
          storms and convulsions of nature that are occurring by sea and
          land, filling the heart with dread at the sight of every dark cloud
          that arises. The tidal waves and volcanic upheavals at sea have, in
          the last two or three decades, been marked with extraordinary
          violence. On land, cyclones and earthquakes have carried on a
          fearful work of destruction. Many instances might be cited to
          substantiate this statement, but the events are too familiar to
          require it. Hardly a week passes but some great calamity of this
          kind is recorded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          expression referred to is probably susceptible of another
          application in which it will be found to be as forcible and
          pertinent to the present state of affairs as in the one just
          noticed. This would be to give the term <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sea and waves”</span> its symbolic meaning. The
          prophet of old said: <span class="tei tei-q">“And behold the four
          winds of heaven strove upon the great sea.”</span> Dan. 7:2. We are
          told that the sea represents <span class="tei tei-q">“peoples, and
          multitudes, and nations, and tongues.”</span> Rev. 17:15. Taking
          the words in this sense, the meaning and fulfillment are still as
          apparent as before; and the expression joins its force to that of
          the remainder of the passage—<span class="tei tei-q">“upon the
          earth distress of nations, with perplexity; <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the sea and the waves roaring; men's
          hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things
          which are coming on the earth.”</span> In this sense the expression
          in question would indicate commotion and violent disturbance in the
          social and political world. In this meaning all will at once see
          the vivid force of the text as applied to our times.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The times we
          live in are anomalous to any that have ever preceded us. For some
          years there have been universal and active preparations for war,
          and almost universal peace. To secure the greatest efficiency of
          armed forces for defensive and offensive purposes, has been the
          prime consideration of government, especially so, as far as the Old
          World nations are concerned. Europe echoes to the tread of vast
          hosts of war while the nations are driven to their wits' end to
          provide for their support. It is well known that these costly
          preparations are not for show; and the hearts of men quail in view
          of the culmination which, though delayed, must soon be reached.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
          temple of Janus is closed as far as international strife is
          concerned, and angel hands are holding the winds of war (see Rev.
          7:1-3), internal strife and dissension are rending the vitals of
          the great nations of earth. Within the confines of its own border,
          each of these nations is cherishing elements of the deadliest
          nature. Trouble is brewing that has for the people far more terror
          than foreign complications. For some time the ominous mutterings of
          an oncoming storm have been heard in every land, and it requires no
          remarkable acumen to discern the rapid approach of the crisis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostle
          James strikes directly at the matter in a prophetic glance and

          your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and
          the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your
          flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the
          last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down
          your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the
          cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the
          Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been
          wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye
          have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist
          you.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostle
          locates the circumstances he here refers to in the last days. He
          denounces the rich men who have heaped together treasures, the rust
          and canker of which will be a witness against them. They live in
          pleasure and wantonness while the cries of those whose wages they
          have kept back enter into the ears of the Lord of Hosts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
          universal cry of hard times in all the world. It is hard to obtain
          money; and yet, there never was so much money as at present. But it
          is being collected—gathered in heaps—by the powerful few, while the
          limited means of the masses are dwindling lower and lower. The
          poorer classes witness the absorption of wealth by the money-kings,
          with feelings that are being aroused to the point of desperation by
          the sense of their inability to secure what seems to them a more
          equitable distribution of the things of this world. The laborers
          cry, and God hears their cry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That these
          things are taking place to-day as the most prominent feature of our
          social life no one will for a moment deny. Such colossal fortunes
          the world has heretofore at most but dreamed of. There are men
          living to-day who have risen in wealth from obscure stations to
          become lords <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg
          059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of untold millions. Their wealth passes the bounds of just
          computation, for it includes the power of oppression by which it
          may be indefinitely increased. The lavish expenditure of these
          means for selfish pleasure often amounts to wantonness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Well then, what
          is to be done? It is a difficult and delicate matter to frame and
          secure legislation by which this or any other class of men shall be
          deprived of the management of their own business as long as that
          business is legitimate and is legitimately conducted. Shall anarchy
          and violence be resorted to? Shall the laborer seize the torch and
          the weapons of death? Shall the country be devastated by strikes,
          strife, and civil war? Shall our communities be rent with murder,
          arson, treason, and intense personal hatred and enmity? No one
          possessing the natural instincts of humanity could contemplate such
          a condition of affairs except with horror. There are ghouls of
          society who gloat in blood; but such are not true citizens, they
          are not neighbors, they certainly are not Christians.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what shall
          we do as citizens, neighbors, and Christians? This is a question of
          great importance just now. Inspiration long ago foresaw our
          situation. The pitying Saviour long since anticipated the
          sufferings that are to come upon this generation; and having,
          through his servant, outlined the present condition of affairs so
          closely, he certainly would not leave his followers uninformed as
          to the course he would have them pursue. We have to read only two
          verses farther in James's letter to find the counsel we need.</p>

          revolt, combination and intrigue, strife and bloodshed, never will
          cease until the supreme selfishness, which in the absence of divine
          grace controls all men, gives place to true philanthropy, and a
          brotherhood that is not outlined by class or sectional interests.
          This happy time is coming. When Jesus comes, he will take to
          himself his power and reign in righteousness. Then will the hills
          be brought low, the valleys exalted, the crooked be made straight,
          and the rough places smooth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who are
          weary of strife, those who through misfortune or oppression have
          been made to feel their need of relief will find rest to their
          souls in looking for the coming of the Lord. It is vain to match
          evil with evil or to try to cure wrong with wrong. The gospel of
          Christ is the only remedy for these ills. And all that we can
          really do to counteract the annoyances of this life must be done
          through the gospel of peace. In this time of perplexity, distress,
          and fear, let every Christian hold up Christ. Let his patient
          suffering be exemplified in whatever circumstances may come. Just a
          little beyond, there is relief.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strikes,
          boycotts, lock-outs, trusts, unions, or any other human device or
          demonstration only augments the trouble, as the experience of the
          past few years shows. For there never was so much of these things
          as now, and never was capital so insecure, business so uncertain,
          and labor in such distress as at present. The employment of
          arbitrary force provokes greater efforts on the opposite side, and
          thus the breach is widened and the strife becomes more bitter. We
          do not argue the merits or demerits of the case. That there is deep
          wrong involved, the fruits plainly show. It is our task only to
          point out the one remedy available alike to <span class=

          apprehend that this circumstance will occur as a sign of Christ's
          coming, but rather that it will constitute one of the events of his
          coming, the same as the features mentioned in the next verse. An
          evident distinction may be drawn between the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">signs</span></em>
          of the advent and the circumstances of it. With the falling of the
          stars, the former cease; and with the next event the latter
          commence. This event, the shaking of the powers of heaven, we must
          regard as being future. It holds the same place in the events of
          this chapter, that the departing of the heavens as a scroll does in
          the events of the sixth seal of Revelation 6. Both follow the
          falling stars. The Scriptures plainly teach that, prior to the
          resurrection of the just by the voice of the Son of God, the voice
          of God the Father will shake the heavens and the earth, when will
          be fulfilled the shaking of the powers of the heaven. This is not
          the voice of the Son of God as he descends to raise the dead. It
          comes from the throne of God in the temple of heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Neither is this
          one of the signs showing that the coming of the Son of man is near,
          but <span class="tei tei-q">“the sign of the Son of man in
          heaven.”</span> It is that which indicates his position. When
          Christ ascended from the mount of Olivet, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a cloud received him”</span> from the sight of his
          disciples. They still gazed at the cloud as it rolled upward,
          bearing the Saviour toward the Father's throne but they could not
          see his person. When he comes <span class="tei tei-q">“in like
          manner”</span> as he was taken up to heaven, the cloud will appear,
          small in the distance, but as it draws near, it will signify to
          those who are looking for his return, that he is there, and soon
          his presence will fill the earth with matchless glory. In Rev.
          14:14, the holy seer records his view of the coming Saviour in the
          following words: <span class="tei tei-q">“And I looked, and behold
          a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of
          man.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not a
          mass of vapor but a cloud of resplendent glory. He comes
          <span class="tei tei-q">“with power and great glory.”</span> He
          will <span class="tei tei-q">“come in the glory of his
          Father”</span> (Matt. 16:27); in his own glory, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and all the holy angels with him.”</span> Matt. 25:31.
          The glory of the Father, of the Son, and of all the holy
          angels—this glory will comprise the cloud which attends him on the
          way. Of its intensity we can form no just conception. In the
          presence of one angel the Roman guard <span class="tei tei-q">“did
          quake and became as dead men.”</span> There are ten thousand times
          ten thousand and thousands of thousands of them in this throng.
          Above the brightness of their glory is that of the Father and the
          Son.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg

          wonderful spectacle. The trumpet resounds, the voice of the
          Archangel awakens the dead, and they come forth to share in the
          glorious revelation of their Redeemer. All nature is convulsed with
          her coming dissolution. Each moment the glory draws nearer, and
          soon the wicked can no longer endure the sight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is sometimes
          claimed that the generation spoken of was the one then living. If
          so, it could have been to no greater extent than referring to the
          answer of the question relating to the destruction of Jerusalem.
          But it would be wholly illogical to limit the application of the
          statement to that generation or to place its principal significance
          there. <span class="tei tei-q">“All these things”</span> must
          include the signs and circumstances of which Christ has been
          speaking. In the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg
          068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          preceding verses he gives the parable of the fig-tree, and
          addresses those who are to be living at that time directly.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“So likewise <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ye</span></em>,
          when <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ye</span></em> shall see all these things,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">know</span></em> that it is near.”</span> And
          then, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This</span></em>
          generation shall not pass.”</span> What generation? Evidently the
          one which he was addressing, and which saw <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“these things come to pass.”</span> Not only does such
          an interpretation do no violence to the Saviour's meaning, but it
          is obviously the only one that can be reasonably entertained in
          regard to it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Paul speaks in
          the first person of those who will be living when Jesus comes, for
          he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“We shall not all sleep, but we
          shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
          the last trump.”</span> 1 Cor. 15:51, 52. Or, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
          together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
          air.”</span> 1 Thess. 4:17. The things here mentioned by the
          apostle did not take place in his day. They have not yet taken
          place. Notwithstanding, he speaks of them as though they would take
          place in his day, and as if he were to have a part in them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proclamation
          of the coming and kingdom of Christ is given to the last
          generation. God sent Noah to preach to the last generation before
          the flood, not to any preceding one. The very generation which was
          destroyed by the waters of the flood saw Noah build the ark, and
          heard his warning voice. So God has raised up men to give the
          solemn warning to the world at the right time to give force to the
          warning. And the very generation of men that live after the three
          great signs are fulfilled, and who hear and reject the warning
          message of Heaven, will drink the cup of the unmingled wrath of
          God. And those of this very generation who receive the message,
          suffer disappointments, and endure the trials of the waiting
          position, will witness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg
          069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the coming of Christ, and exclaim, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo,
          this is our God; we have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">waited</span></em> for him, and he will save
          us.”</span> Isa. 25:9.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With what
          emphasis our Lord gave utterance to this sentiment! It is a rebuke
          upon our unbelief. As we read it, God help us to believe it:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily I say unto you, This generation
          shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.”</span> And as
          though this were not enough to lead us to unwavering faith, he adds
          these forcible words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven and earth
          shall pass away but my words shall not pass away.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The word and
          promises of men may fail; but Christ has given assurance that his
          word, and his word in reference to this solemn truth, will stand
          though heaven and earth fail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This has become
          a very familiar passage of scripture because of the frequent use
          that is made of it to prove that nothing can be known of the
          proximity of the second coming of Christ. But if we pause a moment
          and lay beside this verse those we have just studied, we shall be
          able to discover the exact truth at once. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“When ye shall see these things, know that it is near
          even at the doors;”</span> and, <span class="tei tei-q">“This
          generation shall not pass, till all these things be
          fulfilled;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“But of that day and
          hour knoweth no man.”</span> The line of knowledge, then, lies
          between the former expressions and the latter—between <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“even at the doors”</span> and the definite day and
          hour. The former we may know, and every Christian is commanded to
          know. The latter no man knoweth. One may consistently say that he
          knows an event is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg
          071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          near, and yet say that he does not know the hour nor the day when
          it will take place. That this is the scriptural teaching upon this
          point may be readily proved by a reference to 1 Thess. 5:1-4:—</p>

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

          have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly
          that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For

          cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they
          shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An evident
          distinction is here drawn between two classes. Upon one class the
          day of the Lord will come as a thief. Those of the other are not in
          darkness that that day should come as a thief upon them. The
          children of God are children of light. Their heavenly Father knows
          the end from the beginning, and he has promised to reveal his
          secret to his people through his servants the prophets. Amos
          3:7.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostle
          Peter also bears testimony to the same truth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dark place
          here spoken of is the future. The past is lighted up by history,
          the present is brought to our knowledge by press and telegraph; but
          the future no human art or wisdom can penetrate. Prophecy throws
          its gleam into those dark regions, yet unexplored, and marks out
          the path of human history centuries and ages before it has echoed
          to the footsteps of mankind. When at last we pass along the
          pathway, we may, if we will, recognize the waymarks set up here and
          there, every one of which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg
          072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          is a monument to the wisdom and knowledge of God, and the
          faithfulness of his word. Those who have no eyes to discern these
          things, no ears to hear, nor hearts to understand their
          significance, will pass on, and the final event will come upon them
          unawares. Not so with those who take heed to the things God has
          spoken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We would not
          detract an iota from the force of the verse under consideration. It
          means all it says. No man knows the definite time of Christ's
          coming. The day and hour, and even the year of the second advent
          are purposely hidden. Some of the prophetic periods reach to the
          time of the end, while others extend still farther down, very near
          to the end itself; yet none of them reach to the coming of the Son
          of man. The prophecies clearly point to the period of the second
          advent, but do not give the definite time of that event.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But with this
          passage before us we may claim that it would be transcending its
          meaning to claim upon its authority that nothing should or could be
          known of the approach of Christ's coming. More than that, it is not
          inconsistent with the text nor improbable that prior to that event
          the Lord will in his own way reveal that which has hitherto been
          withheld. Those who claim that the text proves that nothing may be
          known of the period of the second advent, make it prove too much
          for their own unbelief. As recorded by Mark, the declaration reads:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But of that day and that hour knoweth no
          man, no, not the angels which are in Heaven, neither the Son, but
          the Father.”</span> If the text proves that men will know nothing
          of the period of the second advent, it also proves that angels will
          know nothing of it, and also that the Son will know nothing of it,
          till the event takes place! This position proves too much,
          therefore proves nothing to the point. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Christ will know of the period of his second
          advent to this world. The holy angels who wait around the throne of
          heaven to receive messages relative to the part they act in the
          salvation of men, will know of the time of this closing event of
          salvation. And so will the waiting, watching people of God
          understand. An old English version of the passage reads,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“But that day and hour no man maketh known,
          neither the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the
          Father.”</span> This is the correct reading, according to several
          of the ablest critics of the age. The word <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> is
          used in the same sense here that it is by Paul in 1 Cor. 2:2:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“For I determined not to know [make known]
          anything among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified.”</span>
          Men will not make known the day and hour, angels will not make it
          known, neither will the Son; but the Father will make it known.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the fatal
          consequences of not watching is distinctly stated in Rev. 3:3:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In consequence
          of not watching, the people will remain in ignorance of the
          approach of that hour. And the unavoidable inference is that by
          watching they will be aware of and prepared for its coming. In
          answer to the agonizing prayer of the Son of God, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Father, glorify thy name,”</span> there came a voice
          from heaven, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have both glorified
          it, and will glorify it again.”</span> The disciples understood
          these words from heaven, while the people that stood by said it
          thundered. John 12:27-29. So will the waiting disciples of Christ
          understand the voice of God when he shall speak from on high. But
          the unbelieving world will not understand it. In comparing Noah's

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A picture of the
          present condition of the mass of mankind is here drawn. The people
          of the last generation will be like those before the flood, while
          the ark was preparing. While Noah preached, and warned them of the
          coming flood, they mocked. He built the ark; and they scoffed and
          jeered. He was a preacher of righteousness. His works were
          calculated to give edge to, and send home to the heart, what he
          preached. Every righteous sermon, and every blow struck in building
          the ark, condemned a careless, scoffing world. As the time drew
          nearer, the people grew more careless, more hardened, more bold and
          impudent, and their condemnation surer. Noah and his family stood
          alone. And could one family know more than all the world? The ark
          was a matter of ridicule, and Noah was regarded as a willful
          bigot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Lord
          calls Noah into the ark. And by the hand of Providence the beasts
          are led into the ark; and the Lord shuts Noah in. This is regarded
          at first by the scoffing multitude as something wonderful; but it
          is soon explained away by the wiser ones, so as to calm their
          fears, and they breathe easier.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day of
          expectation finally arrives. The sun rises as usual, and the
          heavens are clear. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now where is old Noah's
          flood?”</span> is heard from a thousand impious lips. The farmer is
          caring for his herds and lands, and the mechanic is pursuing his
          work of building. On this very day, some are being joined in
          marriage. With many it is a day of unusual feasting and sports. And
          while all are looking to long years of future prosperity and
          happiness, suddenly the heavens gather blackness. Fear fills every
          heart. The windows <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg
          076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of heaven open, and the rain descends in torrents. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The fountains of the great deep are broken up,”</span>
          and here and there come gushing up rivers of water. The valleys are
          fast filling up, and thousands are swept away in death. Awful
          death! made still more horrible by being in consequence of slighted
          mercy! But where is Noah? Ah! safe in the ark, borne upon the
          billows. Safe from the flood, for God <span class="tei tei-q">“shut
          him in.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By some people,
          the evidences of the soon coming of Christ are considered
          insufficient to base faith upon. But the testimony and acts of one
          man in the case of Noah, condemned the people destroyed by the
          flood. The evidences then were sufficient, otherwise the world
          would not have been condemned. But a hundred times more convincing
          evidences come pouring in upon us that the day of the Lord is near,
          and hasteth greatly. We follow down the several prophetic chains of
          Daniel and of the Revelation, and we find ourselves in every
          instance standing just before the day of wrath. We see the signs
          spoken of by prophets, by Christ, and by the apostles, fulfilling
          or fulfilled. And at the right time, and in the right manner, to
          fulfill certain prophecies, a solemn message arises in different
          parts of the world: <span class="tei tei-q">“Blow ye the trumpet in
          Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the
          inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord cometh,
          for it is nigh at hand.”</span> Joel 2:1. Wherever we look, we see
          prophecy fulfilling. While the knowledge of God and the spirit of
          holiness are departing, spiritual wickedness, like a flood, covers
          the land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But these
          evidences are considered insufficient to rest faith upon. Well,
          what kind of evidence would the unbelieving have? <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“When the signs of the end,”</span> says the skeptic,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“are fulfilled, they will be so plain that
          no one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg
          077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          can doubt.”</span> But if the signs are of such a nature, and are
          fulfilled in such a manner, as to compel all to believe in the
          coming of Christ, how can it be as it was in the days of Noah? Men
          were not then compelled to believe. But eight believing souls were
          saved, while all the world besides sank in their unbelief beneath
          the waters of the flood. God has never revealed his truth to man in
          a manner to compel him to believe. Those who have wished to doubt
          his word, have found a wide field in which to doubt, and a broad
          road to perdition; while those who have wished to believe, have
          ever found an everlasting rock upon which to rest their faith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just before the
          end, the world will be hardened in sin, and indifferent to the
          claims of God. Men will be careless in regard to the warnings of
          danger, and blinded by cares, pleasures, and riches. An unbelieving
          generation will be eating, drinking, marrying, building, planting,
          and sowing. It is right to eat and drink to sustain nature, but the
          sin is in excess and gluttony. The marriage covenant is holy, but
          God's glory is seldom thought of. Building, planting, and sowing,
          necessary for convenient shelter, food, and clothing, are right;
          but the world has gone wholly after these things, so that men have
          no time nor disposition to think of God, heaven, Christ's coming,
          and the Judgment. This world is their god, and all their energies
          of body and mind are made to serve it. And the evil day is put far
          away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The faithful
          watchman who sounds the alarm as he sees destruction coming, is
          held up before the people from the pulpits of our land, and by the
          religious press, as a fanatic, a teacher of dangerous heresies;
          while in contrast is set forth a long period of peace and
          prosperity to the church. So the churches are quieted to sleep. The

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attitude of
          the religious world toward this most important subject is worthy of
          more than passing notice both because of its effect upon the cause
          of truth and also because it of itself is a sign of the times.
          While it is true that many individuals in the different Christian
          denominations recognize with more or less distinctness the fact
          that we are living in the last days, with many of these
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name=
          "Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it does not become a
          practical truth. Outside of these there are many who ridicule the
          idea as preposterous and outlandish; and in opposition to the
          message that Christ is soon coming, raise the cry of, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace, peace, when there is no peace.”</span> Such
          teaching is alluded to by the prophet in Eze. 13:10, 11.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The groundwork
          of the peace and safety cry is the doctrine of the temporal
          millennium. This teaches that the world is now entering, or about
          to enter upon a period of universal peace and good will, that the
          moral tone of the world is improving, men and nations are learning
          righteousness; and the gospel of Christ is about to become the
          controlling principle in public and private life. And, further,
          this happy state will continue for one thousand years, which period
          of time the word millennium literally signifies. At the end of that
          time, perhaps, the Lord will come. However, if this doctrine be
          true, it will make but little difference to this generation or to
          the one living at the close of the period whether he does or not.
          The verses we have just considered which liken the last days to
          those of Noah wholly disprove this position. In addition to what
          Matthew states, Luke gives a still more forcible version of our
          Saviour's words:—</p>

          Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they

          faith on the earth?”</span> Luke 18:8. The idea of a thousand years
          of peace and righteousness before Christ comes might be dismissed
          as utterly out of the question. But space will be given to one or
          two passages supposed to teach it, which will represent the whole

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost the same
          language is used in Micah 4:1-3. It is enough to call attention to
          the authorship of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg
          082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Many people shall go and say, Come
          ye,”</span> etc. Inspiration asserts that in the last days the
          mountain or power of the Lord's house or church shall be
          established in the tops of the mountains, or civil power.
          Undoubtedly it will. Everything is tending to the union of Church
          and State and the professed church of Christ is riding on a high
          tide to civil power in all lands. But farewell to godliness and
          spiritual power. When this is accomplished, in a general chorus all
          will proclaim the dawning millennium.</p>

          that event. This fact is convincing evidence that the Lord is not
          displeased with those who anticipate his coming, and study the word
          in reference to it. No one watches for that which he does not
          expect, and indifference or aversion toward the coming of Christ is
          sure evidence of coldness toward Christ himself. If we love Jesus,
          we shall love his appearing and if we love his appearing, we shall
          be eagerly watching and waiting for it. But if we knew the hour
          when he would come, we should not watch for his coming, nor could
          we with eagerness expect his coming if we had no knowledge of its
          approach. The course of time has been measured off in definite
          periods down to the beginning of the present generation. The time
          from the end of the prophetic periods to the coming of Christ is
          emphatically the waiting, watching time. Those who watch, as our
          Lord commands, will eventually know the time. No man will make it
          known, for it is not revealed to man in the Scriptures. Angels will
          not make it known, though they may minister to, and communicate
          with, the children of men. Neither will the Son. But the Father
          will make it known when he speaks again from heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
          undoubtedly true that the unscriptural and irrational course
          pursued by many so-called Adventists in repeatedly setting a time
          of their own for the Lord to come has had the effect to disgust
          many with the whole <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg

          matter. This is the enemy's work. He will seek thus to obscure each
          truth by bringing it into the shadow of reproach. But it is unwise
          to be thus misled. Probably there is no prophecy that better
          describes the present state of unbelief in the world in regard to
          the second advent, caused partly by fanatical time-movements, than
          the following:—</p>

          of caring for his church to his servants. A blessing is promised
          those servants who are found faithfully discharging this duty when

          truth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And meat in due
          season when Christ's coming draws near, will be the gospel of the
          kingdom. Verse 14. It will embrace warnings, instructions, and
          encouragements pertaining to a message that is designed and adapted
          to prepare the world for so solemn an event. Suppose, for a moment,
          that when Noah had received his message of the coming flood to give
          to the world, he had reasoned with worldly wisdom that as such a
          thing never had occurred, and from all appearances seemed very
          unlikely to occur, and hence to preach it would subject him to
          reproach, it would be better to avoid any particular allusion to
          such an unwelcome subject. His preaching seemed to excite only
          ridicule. He could retain his own private convictions and preach
          the ordinary principles of righteousness, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Do not so, my brethren.”</span> And if the people were
          only prepared for the flood, that would be all that would be
          necessary. Of such a course we can say two things. He would thus
          have proved very unfaithful to his trust, and the blood of his
          fellow-men would have been upon him; and he would have done just as
          thousands are doing now. He certainly would not have represented
          the faithful and wise servant. So it is now. A solemn
          responsibility is placed upon the watchmen:—</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">Conclusion.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The impression
        prevails to some extent that he who teaches that Christ is soon
        coming is acting the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">rôle</span></span> of an alarmist. If so, we
        have seen that the great Teacher has placed himself at the head of
        the class. No one has spoken more positively upon this point than he
        has done. He said, <span class="tei tei-q">“In my Father's house are
        many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to
        prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I
        will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there
        ye may be also.”</span> John 14:2, 3. There is nothing ambiguous
        about that language. A child can understand it. It means that Jesus
        will come again. In the remarkable chapter we have here reviewed, the
        Saviour takes up the subject specifically, and not only affirms the
        fact of his coming, but foretells in explicit language the events
        which he would have us recognize as signs of the near approach of his
        coming and the end of the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the message of
        Christ's second coming is not sensational in its essential character.
        It is a solemn, practical truth. It is full of warning and admonition
        to sinners and worldly professors, and full of comfort to the
        faithful followers of Christ. It is spoken of in the Scriptures as a
        fact, established upon the word which never fails. When speaking
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095"
        id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of his second advent, the
        Saviour said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven and earth shall pass
        away, but my word shall not pass away.”</span> Matt. 24:35. To
        disbelieve in his coming would be to doubt one of the two great
        features of the gospel plan. What the harvest is to seed-time,
        Christ's second advent will be to his first. To doubt that he ever
        came to earth would be to subvert the gospel. To disbelieve his
        second coming would nullify in the mind his first coming, and rob the
        sacrifice of its glorious reward.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apostle Paul
        speaks of the second advent as <span class="tei tei-q">“that blessed
        hope.”</span> Titus 2:13. Jesus says: <span class="tei tei-q">“And
        when these things [the signs of his coming] begin to come to pass,
        then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth
        nigh.”</span> The prophet Isaiah anticipates the feelings of God's
        people who will witness the event, and expresses them in the
        following manner: <span class="tei tei-q">“And it shall be said in
        that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will
        save us: This is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad
        and rejoice in his salvation.”</span> Isa. 25:9.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At his coming, the
        dead in Christ will be raised to everlasting life. The righteous
        living will be changed to immortality. The hand of our Saviour will
        wipe away all tears; <span class="tei tei-q">“there shall be no more
        death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more
        pain; for the former things are passed away.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Why should we not
        rejoice in such a prospect? Who would not welcome such a friend? Who
        would not rejoice in the prospect of such a consummation?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is true
        that the grand event will not be attended with joy alone. There will
        be dismay and anguish. For while one prophet records the exclamations
        of joyful anticipation, another has foreseen and recorded the cry of
        despair. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg
        096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And the kings of the earth, and the great
        men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men,
        and every bondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and
        in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks,
        Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the
        throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his
        wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?”</span> Rev. 6:15-17.
        A vast number will thus lament. All who cannot join the shout of
        welcome will unite in the wail of despair. There will be but two
        classes in that day. And to one of those classes each one living will
        belong. To which shall I belong? Solemn question. To which party will
        you belong, reader? No one can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wait</span></em> for Christ who is not prepared
        for his coming. Only the precious blood of Jesus that cleanses from
        sin can prepare us to receive him and fit us to dwell in his
        presence. Have you an interest in his forgiving love? Is your peace
        made with God? If so, his coming will have no terror to you, for he
        comes to save his waiting people.</p>

        Bible history—themes not in themselves new, but so presented here as
        to give them a new significance. Beginning with the rebellion in
        heaven, the author shows why sin was permitted, why Satan was not

        man's temptation and fall; and rehearses the plan of redemption
        devised for his salvation. This volume traces the great conflict

        CREATION.</span></span>—A nicely illustrated work setting forth
        clearly and simply the relation between God's work in creation and
        redemption. The signs of power and greatness that mark the handiwork
        of God in the visible universe are shown to be but indications of the
        unfailing strength with which he works in the lives of those who
        submit to his will. The confirmation of the truths of the gospel
        drawn from the study of the creation will make this book a valuable
        one to all who are watching with interest the attacks that are now
        made on the authority of the Bible.</p><span class="tei tei-ab">In

              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways
              including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

              "tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the
              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by
              copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.
              Thus, we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any
              particular paper edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each ebook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the ebook's ebook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our ebooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=
